[[UnitTest-Overview]]
== Overview

Jenkins comes with a test harness built around JUnit to make test
development simpler.This harness provides the following features:

. Starts an embedded servlet container so that the test code can
exercise user interaction through HTTP and assert based on the outcome.
. http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/[HtmlUnit] with a bit of enhancements
allows you to productively test HTTP/UI interaction.
. Prepares and tears down a fresh Jenkins instance for each test case.
So each test method will run in a fresh environment, isolated from other
tests.
. Test code can also directly access Jenkins object model. This allows
tests to assert directly against the internal state of Jenkins, as well
as perform some operations directly, as opposed to doing so only through
the HTML scraping.
. Declarative annotations to specify the environment in which a test
will be run. For example, your test method can request that
Jenkins shall be started with a certain `+JENKINS_HOME+` contents.
. Declarative annotations to maintain association between tests and
bugs/discussions.

If you are using the Plugin Parent POM 2.3 or later the version of the
Jenkins Test Harness (which starting in version 2.0 is an artifact
independent from Jenkins Core) to be used for the tests can be
configured using the `+jenkins-test-harness.version+`. For 1.x versions
of the Plugin POM the version used is the same of the parent POM which
is equal to the Jenkins baseline version. The recommended version of
Jenkins Test Harness is 2.1 or above unless your plugin depends on
Jenkins < 1.580.

[[UnitTest-Example]]
== Example

The following code shows a very simple test case. Your test will use
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/JenkinsRule[JenkinsRule] to
provide test fixtures for some of those features outlined above.

Each test method will start with a fresh temporary installation of
Jenkins. The `+first+` method doesn't request any particular
Jenkins data set to seed Jenkins, so it will start from an empty
installation.

The test then proceeds to create a new project and set it up. As you can
see, the code directly talks to the in-memory Jenkins object model.
(There is the `+jenkins+` variable defined in `+JenkinsRule+` that you
can use for access.) While you can do the same by emulating the user
HTTP interaction through HtmlUnit, this way is often a convenient way to
prepare an environment for the code that you want to test.

The test code in this example then switch to HtmlUnit to emulate the UI
interaction and verify that we get results that we expect.

When a test completes, the temporary Jenkins installation will be
destroyed.

[source,groovy]
----
import org.jvnet.hudson.test.JenkinsRule;
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
import hudson.model.*;
import hudson.tasks.Shell;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.Rule;
public class AppTest {
  @Rule public JenkinsRule j = new JenkinsRule();
  @Test public void first() throws Exception {
    FreeStyleProject project = j.createFreeStyleProject();
    project.getBuildersList().add(new Shell("echo hello"));
    FreeStyleBuild build = project.scheduleBuild2(0).get();
    System.out.println(build.getDisplayName() + " completed");
    // TODO: change this to use HtmlUnit
    String s = FileUtils.readFileToString(build.getLogFile());
    assertThat(s, contains("+ echo hello"));
  }
}
----

Tip

You can use `+@ClassRule+` to speed up the test suite if you are
_positive_ that the test cases will not interfere with each other.

[[UnitTest-Howtosetenvironmentvariables]]
=== How to set environment variables

When preparing your virtual test environment, you may wish to simulate
Jenkins environment variables that can be set on the Jenkins
configuration page. Adding environment variables to a Jenkins instance
before a test is simple, as the example below demonstrates.

[source,groovy]
----
public void setEnvironmentVariables() throws IOException {
    EnvironmentVariablesNodeProperty prop = new EnvironmentVariablesNodeProperty();
    EnvVars envVars = prop.getEnvVars();
    envVars.put("sampleEnvVarKey", "sampleEnvVarValue");
    j.jenkins.getGlobalNodeProperties().add(prop);
}
----

[[UnitTest-Debugging]]
== Debugging

Your IDE will most likely have the ability to select a single JUnit test
and execute it in the debugger. Otherwise you can run
`+mvn -Dmaven.surefire.debug -Dtest=hudson.SomeTest test+` to accomplish
this.

To debug agents launched by Jenkins, set
`+-Dorg.jvnet.hudson.test.HudsonTestCase.agentDebugPort=PORT+` to the
system property, or from your test case set
`+JenkinsRule.AGENT_DEBUG_PORT+` to a non-0 value.

[[UnitTest-VariousTestTechniques]]
== Various Test Techniques

[[UnitTest-Stubbing]]
=== Stubbing

Sometimes you want to have quick tests which don't start up a 'full'
Jenkins instance - as `+JenkinsRule+` does - as this can take some time.
In that case you shouldn't have your test classes use `+JenkinsRule+`.
(Or you can use `+@WithoutJenkins+` on certain methods.)

As creating most Jenkins core classes without a Jenkins instance is
unfortunately not easy, _stubbing_ can come in handy. One excellent
stubbing and mocking framework is e.g. http://mockito.org/[Mockito]. For
example, if you want to stub a build with a certain result you could do:

[source,groovy]
----
AbstractBuild build = Mockito.mock(AbstractBuild.class);
Mockito.when(build.getResult()).thenReturn(Result.FAILURE);
----

[[UnitTest-HTMLscraping]]
=== HTML scraping

If you'd like to test the HTML generated by Jenkins, XPath test is often
convenient.

[source,groovy]
----
HtmlPage page = j.createWebClient().goTo("computer/test/");
HtmlElement navbar = page.getElementById("left-top-nav");
assertEquals(1,navbar.selectNodes(".//a").size());
----

[[UnitTest-Submittingforms]]
=== Submitting forms

Submitting a form through HtmlUnit in Jenkins is a bit trickier than it
should be. This is because
<<Structured-Form-Submission>> is done in JavaScript at the form submission time, and
the submit button is usually decorated by YUI, which internally converts
`+<input type="submit">+` to `+<button>+`.

So you'd have to look for the corresponding HtmlButton element, then use
that to call the submit method, like this:

[source,groovy]
----
HtmlPage configPage = j.createWebClient().goTo("configure");
HtmlForm form = configPage.getFormByName("config");
form.submit((HtmlButton)last(form.getHtmlElementsByTagName("button")));
----

[[UnitTest-DealingwithproblemsinJavaScript]]
=== Dealing with problems in JavaScript

When JavaScript throws an exception and causes a test to fail, it will
often print a long chain of nested exceptions. Notice that the stack
trace includes synthesized stack frames for JavaScript, which is
different from the actual Java execution stack.

The original HtmlUnit doesn't really do a good job of chaining all
exceptions together, so we are patching HtmlUnit to make sure it retains
the full stack trace leading up to the root cause. If you found a case
where this chain is broken, please file a bug.

If you set a break point in Java code, and if your execution suspends
while its directly/indirectly invoked through JavaScript, you can use
`+JenkinsRule.jsDebugger+` to introspect JavaScript call stack and its
local variables. This is often very useful in identifying where in
JavaScript things went wrong.

[[UnitTest-Configurationround-triptesting]]
=== Configuration round-trip testing

One of the very useful test idioms for
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/Builder[Builder],
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/Publisher[Publisher], and
anything that has configuration forms is the round-trip testing. This
test goes like this:

. Programmatically construct a fully populated instance
. Request a configuration page via HtmlUnit
. Submit the config page without making any changes
. Verify that you still have the identically configured instance

[source,groovy]
----
FreeStyleProject p = j.createFreeStyleProject();
YourBuilder before = new YourBuilder("a","b",true,100);
p.getBuildersList().add(before);

j.submit(j.createWebClient().getPage(p,"configure").getFormByName("config"));

YourBuilder after = p.getBuildersList().get(YourBuilder.class);

j.assertEqualBeans(before,after,"prop1,prop2,prop3,...");
----

This test ensures that your configuration page is properly pre-populated
with the current setting of your model object, and it also makes sure
that the submitted values are correctly reflected on the constructed
model object. To be really sure, do this twice with different actual
values — for example, you should try a non-null string and null string,
true and false, etc., to exhaust representative cases.

[[UnitTest-Webpageassertions]]
=== Web page assertions

HtmlUnit has a `+WebAssert+` class that can be used for simple
assertions on HTML pages.

To assert that the System configuration page contains the CVS SCM
configuration entry:

[source,groovy]
----
HtmlPage page = j.createWebClient().goTo("configure");
WebAssert.assertElementPresent(page, "hudson-scm-CVSSCM");
----

To find Elements by name= vs. id=, use `+page.getElementsByName+`.

An example from the ironmqNotifier plugin.

[source,groovy]
----
HtmlPage page = j.createWebClient().goTo("configure");
assertEquals("Expect to find one instance of this name", page.getElementsByName("ironmqNotifier").size(), 1);
assertEquals("Expect to find one instance of this name", page.getElementsByName("org-jenkinsci-plugins-ironmqnotifier-IronMQNotifier").size(), 1);
----

See note on *pom.xml* below if this example gives you `+ClassNotFound+`
errors.

When parsing pages for Number (Long or Integer), you may get the
following error:

[source,groovy]
----
java.lang.ClassCastException: com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlNumberInput cannot be cast to com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlTextInput
----

The supporting library appears to need `+HtmlNumberInput+` instead
of `+HtmlTextInput+` to function correctly with numbers.  

Make the following change...

Before

[source,groovy]
----
HtmlTextInput inputElement = page.getElementByName("_.defaultExpirySeconds");
----

After

[source,groovy]
----
HtmlNumberInput inputElement = page.getElementByName("_.defaultExpirySeconds");
----

[[UnitTest-DoingthingsdifferentlyinJavaScriptwhenitrunsasunittest]]
=== Doing things differently in JavaScript when it runs as unit test

JavaScript in Jenkins can test whether it's running in the unit test or
not by checking the global `+isRunAsTest+` variable defined in
`+hudson-behavior.js+`, which is included in all the pages. This can be
used to disable some ajax operations, for example. Obviously, this has
to be used with caution so that tests will continue to test the real
thing as much as possible.

[[UnitTest-TestCaseasaRootAction]]
=== TestCase as a http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/RootAction[RootAction]

An instance of the test case being executed is added to Jenkins' URL
space as `+/self+` because `+JenkinsRule+` is itself a `+RootAction+`.
Among other things, this enables your test class to define Jelly views,
and invoke it like `+j.createWebClient().goTo("self/myview")+`.

[[UnitTest-Testingauthorizationbehaviours]]
=== Testing authorization behaviours

Unit test harness contains a
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/SecurityRealm[SecurityRealm]
implementation suitable for unit tests. This can be installed to as
follows:

[source,groovy]
----
j.jenkins.setSecurityRealm(j.createDummySecurityRealm());
----

This virtual security realm allows login attempts by any username so
long as its password is exactly the same as the username.
`+WebClient.login+` method provides a convenient method that allows you
to login a session object.

[[UnitTest-Custombuilder]]
=== Custom builder

You can extend
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/TestBuilder[TestBuilder] to
write a one-off builder that can coordinate with your test. This is
often convenient to stage things up for testing your
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/Publisher[Publisher], for
example by placing files in the workspace, etc.

[source,groovy]
----
FreeStyleProject project = j.createFreeStyleProject();
project.getBuildersList().add(new TestBuilder() {
    public boolean perform(AbstractBuild<?, ?> build, Launcher launcher,
        BuildListener listener) throws InterruptedException, IOException {
        build.getWorkspace().child("abc.txt").write("hello","UTF-8");
        return true;
    }
});

project.scheduleBuild2(0);
----

http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/OneShotEvent[OneShotEvent] is
also often an useful companion so that the thread that runs your test
method and the thread that runs the build can coordinate — for example,
the following program blocks the main thread until the build starts.

[source,groovy]
----
final OneShotEvent buildStarted = new OneShotEvent();

FreeStyleProject project = j.createFreeStyleProject();
project.getBuildersList().add(new TestBuilder() {
    public boolean perform(AbstractBuild<?, ?> build, Launcher launcher,
        BuildListener listener) throws InterruptedException, IOException {
        buildStarted.signal();
        ...
        return true;
    }
});

project.scheduleBuild2(0);
buildStarted.block(); // wait for the build to really start
----

[[UnitTest-RegisteringExtensionsduringtests]]
=== Registering Extensions during tests

During the test, one might want to register extensions just during that
particular test, for example to assist the test scenario. You can do
this by defining such extension as a nested type of your test case class
and put
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/TestExtension[TestExtension]
instead of
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/Extension[Extension].

It lets you tie an extension to just one test method, or all test
methods on the same class.

[[UnitTest-Testharnessannotations]]
== Test harness annotations

There are several annotations in the Jenkins test framework.

[[UnitTest-Informationalannotations]]
=== Informational annotations

[[UnitTest-@Issue("JENKINS-12345")]]
==== @Issue("JENKINS-12345")

Related issue id in tracker.

[[UnitTest-@For(FooBar.class)]]
==== @For(FooBar.class)

Production classes that tests are related to. Useful when the
relationship between the test class name and the test target class is
not obvious.

[[UnitTest-@Url(http://internet.org)]]
==== @Url(\http://internet.org/[http://internet.org])

URL to the web page indicating a problem related to this test case.

[[UnitTest-@Email(http://....)]]
==== @Email(http://....)

URL to the e-mail archive. Look for the e-mail in
http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-users-f361316.html or http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-dev-f387835.html

[[UnitTest-Testenvironmentannotations]]
=== Test environment annotations

[[UnitTest-@PresetData(SecurityPreset)]]
==== @PresetData(SecurityPreset)

Runs a test case with one of the preset `+JENKINS_HOME+` data set:

* `+NO_ANONYMOUS_READACCESS+` - Secured Jenkins that has no anonymous
read access. Any logged in user can do anything.
* `+ANONYMOUS_READONLY+` - Secured Jenkins where anonymous user is
read-only, and any logged in user has a full access.

[[UnitTest-@WithoutJenkins]]
==== @WithoutJenkins
Runs a test case without creating a Jenkins instance.
Annotate individual tests as `@WithoutJenkins` within a unit test class that uses `JenkinsRule`.
Tests annotated with `@WithoutJenkins` will not start a Jenkins instance for the annotated test.
This allows a unit test class to use `JenkinsRule` for most test methods while not spending the time or effort to start a Jenkins instance for those specific test methods that do not require a Jenkins instance.;
See the [WithoutJenkins javadoc](https://javadoc.jenkins.io/component/jenkins-test-harness/org/jvnet/hudson/test/WithoutJenkins.html) for more details.

[[UnitTest-@WithTimeout(TimeoutInSeconds)]]
==== @WithTimeout(TimeoutInSeconds)
Runs a test case with the given timeout expressed in seconds.
