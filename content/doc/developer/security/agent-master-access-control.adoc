[[Whatisthis]]
= Agent to master access control

Historically, Jenkins master and agents behaved as if they all together
form a single distributed process. This means an agent can ask a master
to do just about anything within the confinement of the operating
system, such as accessing files on the master or trigger other jobs on
Jenkins.

This has increasingly become problematic, as larger enterprise
deployments have developed more sophisticated trust separation model,
where the administrators of a master might take agents owned by other
teams. In such an environment, agents are less trusted than the master.

Starting 1.587 (and 1.580.1), Jenkins added a subsystem to put a wall
between a master and an agent to safely allow less trusted agents to be
connected to a master. Since Jenkins 2.0, this subsystem is enabled for
all new installations of Jenkins. If you fit the "larger enterprise
deployment" description above, then we highly recommend you turn this
mode on. The following are examples of deployments that fit this
profile:

* You took agents that are managed by another person who is not Jenkins
administrator because they have special requirement for their build jobs
* You have some jobs that are configured to run on a specific agent
because it is sensitive

To turn this switch on, go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure Global
Security", and check "Enable Agent → Master Access Control"

On the other hand, if all your agents are trusted to the same degree as
your master, then it is safe to leave this subsystem off. The following
are examples of deployments that fit this profile:

* You have set up your Jenkins master and all the agents by yourself
* All the users of your Jenkins have the same access to all the jobs

For this subsystem to function, it needs cooperation from plugins. And
until plugins get updated to work in this new environment, this may
cause seemingly legitimate operations to fail, resulting in broken
builds and other failures.

This Agent page is intended to be the one-stop shop for those who are
experiencing problems due to this subsystem.

== My Jenkins is broken, help!

If you see an exception like the following in console output, logs,
etc., then you are affected by this access control mechanism:

....
java.lang.SecurityException: agent may not create /var/lib/jenkins/foo/bar/...
See http://jenkins-ci.org/security-144 for more details

java.lang.SecurityException: Sending org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.CliGitAPIImpl$GetPrivateKeys from agent to master is prohibited.
See http://jenkins-ci.org/security-144 for more details
....

The first message indicates that an agent tried to access a file on the
master, and Jenkins has blocked that. It is possible that this indicates
an active attack, but it is also possible that plugins that haven't yet
upgraded to work with SECURITY-144 is doing something legitimate.

The second message indicates that an agent has asked the master to
execute a command, and Jenkins has blocked that because the command
isn't classified by plugin developers whether it is safe to be executed
from the agent.

To resolve this problem, you have the following options:

* <<update-plugins>>

* <<kill-switch>>


[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-Checkiftheupdatestopluginsareavailable]]
=== Check if the updates to plugins are available

During the testing of this feature, the following plugins and their
versions have been known to interfere with this subsystem. If you are
using one of those, upgrading those plugins will resolve the problem.
This section will be updated as we discover affected plugins.

[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-Enabletheaccesscontrolmechanism]]
=== Enable the access control mechanism

There are essentially three ways of enabling the access control
mechanism:

. Through web UI, go to \http://your-jenkins:8080/configureSecurity and
check "Enable Agent → Master Access Control" option.
. Through file system, create or edit the
file `+$JENKINS_HOME/secrets/slave-to-master-security-kill-switch+` so
that it contains `+false+`.
. Using a link:/doc/book/managing/groovy-hook-scripts/[Groovy Hook Script]

+
[source,groovy]
----
import jenkins.security.s2m.AdminWhitelistRule
import jenkins.model.Jenkins
Jenkins.instance.getInjector().getInstance(AdminWhitelistRule.class)
.setMasterKillSwitch(false)
----

[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-Disabletheaccesscontrolmechanismaltogether]]
=== Disable the access control mechanism altogether

If all your agents are trusted to the same degree as your master, then
it is safe to disable this subsystem completely. See the top of this
page for a discussion of who can safely do this vs who should avoid
doing this.

If you convinced yourself that this is the right thing to do, you can go
to \http://jenkins/configureSecurity and uncheck "Enable Agent
→ Master Access Control" option. This setting is remembered by
`+$JENKINS_HOME/secrets/slave-to-master-security-kill-switch+`. The file
should either contain `+true+` or `+false+` as the content (when the
_kill-switch_ is set to `+false+`, it means that _Agent → Master Access
Control_ is enabled). If you do not want this be configurable by
an administrator, you can make this file read-only for Jenkins.

For instances that have no agents and instances that do not enable
security, we do not expose this configuration switch as it is pointless.

Your Jenkins deployment may grow over time and start accepting less
trusted agents. It's too easy for that to happen without you remembering
this flag. So be careful when you do this. Please revisit this later to
see if you should enable this subsystem.

[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-Whitelisting]]
== Whitelisting

Jenkins allows administrators to whitelist specific commands and file
accesses on their Jenkins instances. This configuration consists of two
pieces.


[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-Fileaccessrules]]
=== File access rules

File access requests from agents are tested against the rules you specify.
Each rule is a tuple that consists of:

* *allow/deny*: if the following two parameters match the current
request being considered, an "allow" entry would allow the request to be
carried out and a "deny" entry would deny the request to be rejected,
regardless of what later rules might say.
* *operation*: the type of the operation requested. The following 6
values exist. You can also list them separating with ',' or use "all" to
indicate a match for all operations:
** read: read file content or list directory entries
** write: write file content
** mkdirs: create a new directory
** create: create a file in an existing directory
** delete: delete a file or directory
** stat: read metadata of a file/directory, such as timestamp, length,
file access modes.
* *file path*: regular expression that specifies file paths that match
this rule. In addition to
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[the
base regexp syntax], it supports the following tokens:
** `+<JENKINS_HOME>+` can be used as a prefix to match your
$JENKINS_HOME directory
** `+<BUILDDIR>+` can be used as a prefix to match your build record
directory, such as
`+/var/lib/jenkins/job/foo/builds/2014-10-17_12-34-56+`
** `+<BUILDID>+` matches the timestamp-formatted build IDs, like
`+2014-10-17_12-34-56+`.

The rules are ordered and applied in that order. The earliest match
wins. So for example, the following rules allow access to
`+$JENKINS_HOME+` except its `+secrets+` folders:

....
# To avoid hassle of escaping every '\' on Windows, you can use / everywhere, even on Windows.
deny all <JENKINS_HOME>/secrets/.*
allow all <JENKINS_HOME>/.*
....

The following rules are incorrectly written because the 2nd rule will
never match:

....
allow all <JENKINS_HOME>/.*
deny all <JENKINS_HOME>/secrets/.*
....

Rules are read from `+$JENKINS_HOME/secrets/filepath-filters.d/*.conf+`
after sorting these files in alphabetical order.

Jenkins by itself generates `+30-default.conf+` in this directory, which
lists rules that the Jenkins core developers currently think are the
best balance between compatibility and security. This file gets
overwritten by Jenkins every time it starts, but if you do not want to
whitelist these classes for some reasons, you can do so by placing a
file with that name that's not writable by Jenkins.

Jenkins also manages `+50-gui.conf+` in this directory, which is
editable through GUI as discussed later. If you do not want to allow
Jenkins admins to whitelist anything, create an empty file that's not
writable by Jenkins.

Unlike command whitelisting, file access rule decisions can be made
individually based on common sense.

[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-Pathmatching]]
==== Path matching

When a file access is checked, the path of a file being considered is
absolutized (i.e., can be `+/foo/bar/zot+` but not `+./zot+`). It is
also normalized to remove all intermediate "." and "..". So a regular
expression `+/foo/bar/zot.*+` will never match
`+/foo/bar/zot/../../../etc/passwd+`, and likewise a regular expression
`+/foo/bar/../zot/.++` will never match `+/foo/zot/bar+`.

A path is not always canonicalized. So if you have a symlink in
`+/var/lib/jenkins/passwd+` that points to `+/etc/passwd+`, and if you
allow read access to `+/var/lib/jenkins/.*+`, then `+/etc/passwd+` can
be read.

The following Groovy script can be used from
\http://jenkins/script to test the rules:

[source,groovy]
----
import jenkins.security.admin.*;
import jenkins.security.s2m.AdminWhitelistRule;

String op = "write"; // or any other operation like "read"
File f = new File("/userContent/some-path");
Jenkins.instance.injector.getInstance(AdminWhitelistRule.class).checkFileAccess(op,f)
// true means whitelisted. false or SecurityException means rejected
----

More precisely, `+FilePath+` always internally normalize paths, and
while it allows relative paths, no legitimate code will ever use it, so
it shouldn't have to be factored in when writing rules. It isn't that
the access checking subsystem does normalization/absolutization.

[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-WhitelistingfromGUI]]
=== Whitelisting from GUI

On Jenkins, you can go to
\http://jenkins/administrativeMonitor/slaveToMasterAccessControl/
to edit whitelist rules from GUI and have them reflected right away in
the running instance. It consists of the following three sections:

* *Currently whitelisted commands*: See <<command-whitelist>>
for what this field means.

* *Currently rejected commands*: This section lists unclassified
commands that Jenkins has actually rejected. You can check boxes and
submit them to have Jenkins write them into the "currently whitelisted
commands" section. Be careful when you do this, though. 
See <<command-whitelist>> above for the implications.

* *File access rules*: See <<filepath-rules>> for what this field means.

When submitted, these changes are written back to disk and then re-read
right away into Jenkins, including all
`+whitelisted-callables.d/*+``+.conf+` and
`+filepath-filters.d/*+``+.conf+` files.

== I'm a plugin developer. What should I do?

For the access control to work without requiring manual intervention by
users, plugins need to classify their `+Callable+` and `+FileCallable+`
objects whether they are meant to be run on a master or on an agent.

For this purpose, the `+remoting+` library has added the
`+RoleSensitive+` interface with a `+checkRoles()+` method.
`+Callable+`, `+FileCallable+`, and other similar interfaces extend from
this interface. So if you are directly implementing `+Callable+` you
will get an error saying that you have unimplemented abstract methods.

The easiest way to fix this is by extending from
`+MasterToSlaveCallable+`, to indicate that your `+Callable+` is only
meant to be sent from a master to an agent, or
`+SlaveToMasterCallable+`, to indicate that your `+Callable+` is meant
to be sent from an agent to a master. Note that
`+SlaveToMasterCallable+` can still be executed on an agent, as agents
do not perform this access control check. `+FileCallable+` similarly has
`+MasterToSlaveFileCallable+` and `+SlaveToMasterFileCallable+`.

[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-VettingSlaveToMasterCallable/SlaveToMasterFileCallable]]
=== Vetting `+SlaveToMasterCallable+`/`+SlaveToMasterFileCallable+`

When marking `+Callable+` for agent → master, care has to be taken to
ensure that the implementation is not exploitable by malicious agents.

* A malicious agent controls the Java serialization payload, so when
your `+Callable+` gets deserialized on the master, all the serialized
fields are controlled by the agent.
* An agent does not control class definitions on the master, so you can
trust all the classes and methods to behave as it is written. It is not
possible for a malicious agent to change the code executed on the
master.

For example, the following `+SlaveToMasterCallable+` is exploitable.
Callable itself is not public, but a malicious agent can send in
arbitrary `+path+`, so it can be used to read any file on the master:

[source,groovy]
----
// UNSAFE
class SomeCodeThatRunsOnAgent {
    void readBackSomeFileFromMaster() {
        final String path = "...";
        channel.call(new SlaveToMasterCallable<String,IOException>() {
            public String call() {
                return FileUtils.readFileToString(new File(path));
            }
        });
    }
}
----

`+Callable+` that delegates execution to a deserialized object is
dangerous and needs to be carefully examined, because a malicious agent
can designate unintended `+Runnable+` object:

[source,groovy]
----
// UNSAFE
class MyCallable extends SlaveToMasterCallable<Void> {
    Runnable r;
    public Void call() {
        r.run();
        return null;
    }
}
----

To avoid this hassle entirely, consider rewriting your code not to call
back to a master from an agent. Instead, when a master first sends a
command to an agent, you can carry all the data you'll need with you.
This may not be always possible or practical, but it's a lot easier to
secure.

[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-FixingpluginswithoutrequiringnewerJenkins]]
=== Fixing plugins without requiring newer Jenkins

Classifying `+Callable+`/`+FileCallable+` requires new classes added to Jenkins 1.580.1. 
Plugins should require a Jenkins base version that is significantly newer than that minimum requirement.


[[AgentToMasterAccessControl-Fileaccessfromagenttomaster]]
=== File access from agent to master

To avoid getting affected by file access rules, have the master work on
files of an agent, instead of the other way around.

The following code example shows how the code that used to write a file
from an agent now avoids that:

[source,groovy]
----
// PROBLEMATIC
class MySCM extends SCM {
    ...
    public void checkout( ..., FilePath workspace, File _changelogFile ) {
        FilePath changelogFile = new FilePath(_changelogFile);
        workspace.act(new Callable<Void,IOException>() {
            public Void call() {
                // this results in an agent asking the master to open a file for write
                try (OutputStream os = changelogFile.write()) {
                    writeStuffTo(os);
                }
            }
        });
    }
}

// GOOD
class MySCM extends SCM {
    ...
    public void checkout( ..., FilePath workspace, File _changelogFile ) {
        try (final OutputStream out = new RemoteOutputStream(_changelogFile)) {
            workspace.act(new Callable<Void,IOException>() {
                public Void call() {
                    // agent is just writing to a pipe to the master. Quite safe
                    writeStuffTo(out);
                }
            });
        }
    }
}
----

See `+RemoteInputStream+`, `+RemoteOutputStream+`, `+RemoteWriter+`, and
`+Pipe+` for ways to do this.
